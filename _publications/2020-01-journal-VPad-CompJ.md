Abstract: Human–computer interaction through touch screens plays an increasingly important role in our daily lives. Besides smartphones and tablets, laptops are the most prevalent mobile devices for both work and leisure. To satisfy the requirements of some applications, it is desirable to re-equip a typical laptop with both handwriting and drawing capability. In this paper, we design a virtual writing tablet system, VPad, for traditional laptops without touch screens. VPad leverages two speakers and one microphone, which are available in most commodity laptops, to accurately track hand movements and recognize writing characters in the air without additional hardware.
