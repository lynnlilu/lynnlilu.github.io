IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems is a premier international conference in distrubited computing and communication areas. IEEE ICDCS is also a CCF-B conference. 

Presentation Venue: Session 2B (IoT Applications and Security, IoT), IEEE ICDCS 2022 @ Bologna, Italy in Jul. 11, 2022. Due to the epidemic prevention policy of COVID-19 in China, I did not attend the IEEE ICDCS 2022 held in Bologna, Italy. I made the slide for the paper presentation, and my labmate@Rutgers, Wenjin Zhang, presented the paper on behalf of me.
