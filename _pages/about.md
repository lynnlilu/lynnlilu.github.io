Research Interests
======
His research interests include intelligent voice security, autonomous driving security, IoT security, mobile sensing, and ubiquitous computing. The main work is to employ signal processing and machine learning techniques in sensing and communications to realize interesting and futuristic applications, as well as investigate corresponding security vulerabilities underlying these techniques and applications and provide cutting-edge protection mechanism for these systems. 

Currently, I lead the Mobile and Ubiquitous Security Lab (MUSLab), whose name not only embeds the research area, but also indicates the Muses goddess that gives us the sixth sense in researches.
